Bioconductor is an R-based project that specializes in processing biological data, and many specially designed packages are included in it. It clearly define multiple workflows aiming to solve specific bioinformatics problems, such as RNA-seq analysis, gene annotation, etc.

However, some of the workflows contain too many packages and cover too many questions, which makes it difficult for users to understand. Therefore, for the rna-seq data analysis problem in bioinformatics, I made a cheetsheet to conduct some core analysis in the whole flow, which may provide some help to beginners who are unfamiliar with bioconductor as well as rna-seq analysis.
